\paragraph{Abstract.}
Let \(v\) be a positive integer such that \(2 < v\) and let \(X = \{1, 2, \dots, v\}\). Denote by \(\binom{X}{k}\) the collection of all possible \(2\)-subsets of \(X\) and fix total order on it. Define an action of the symmetric group on \(v\) letters \(\mathfrak{S}_v\) on \(\binom{X}{2}\) by taking for all \(b \in \binom{X}{2}\), \(\pi \cdot b := \{\pi(i)  : i \in b\}\), where \(\pi \in \mathfrak{S}_v\). Let \(G \cong \mathfrak{S}_v\) be the subgroup induced by this action on \(\binom{X}{2}\). Let \(G\) act on \(\mathbb{R}^{d}\), where \(d:=\binom{v}{2}\), by permuting coordinates. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be a fundamental domain (for the action of \(G\) on \(\mathbb{R}^d\)) by taking the collection of points in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) that are lexicographically smallest in their \(G\)-orbit.

In this article, we construct a system of linear inequalities such the closure of the resulting convex region contains \(\mathcal{F}\). We accomplish this goal by constructing a poset whose order cone bounds \(\mathcal{F}\). In particular, we show that linear inequalities for the interior can be obtained from this order cone. We also prove that \(\mathcal{F}\) has the property that any \(k\)-face of \(\mathcal{F}\) is a face of a \((k+1)\)-dimensional face of \(\mathcal{F}\).
